> **"This is not just a game — this is how production Python code is written."**

Most beginner scripts break the moment a user types the wrong thing. This project is built to be **indestructible**. It demonstrates how to separate data from logic and handle errors like a senior developer.

## 🚀 Key Features

* 🛡️ **Defensive Engineering:** Zero-crash philosophy using robust `try/except` blocks.
* 🏗️ **Modular Architecture:** Clean separation of concerns (Logic vs. Data vs. UI).
* 🎨 **Rich Terminal UI:** Integrated ASCII art for an immersive CLI experience.
* 🧹 **Graceful Exits:** No ugly traceback errors—just smooth, professional transitions.

## 🛠️ The Architecture

| Component | Responsibility | Technical Concept |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`main.py`** | Game Engine | Flow Control & Logic |
| **`questions.py`** | Data Layer | Data Structures & Imports |
| **`toon.py`** | UI/UX | ASCII Branding & Visuals |

🧠 Learning Objectives

By exploring this project, you will master:

    Modular Programming: Why import is your best friend for scalability.

    Exception Handling: Catching errors before they crash your software.

    OOPS-ready Thinking: Structuring code that is easy to migrate to Classes.

    Input Validation: Ensuring your software handles "human error" gracefully.

🏁 Final Note

    Just don't code... it must be your Art. 👊
